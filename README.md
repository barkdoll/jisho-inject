# 辞書-Inject / Jisho-Inject
Jisho-Inject (pronounced 'g-show', or 'jee-show') is made to help automate the process of adding dictionary definitions into your Anki cards. It parses the proper HTML for my specified template and aligns things using the included CSS.

I will soon add an Anki deck with a sample card that will have the CSS in it for using Jisho-Inject. Formats dictionary definitions into a specific HTML template for use with Anki (the SRS application by Damien Elmes).

The site has an English version and a Japanese version. Since I study Japanese, the app is targeted for Japanese learners, but it can be used to make cards for any language or subject. 

## Is it cross-browser compatible?
The app was built primarily for use with Google Chrome. Since I meant it somewhat just for personal use, I didn't consider going cross-browser. I am not sure how many people will end up finding it useful, but I may add cross-browser support in the future. It also seems to work fine in Firefox. The only issue is that Firefox adds a space to the output box when using the Copy button keyboard shortcut, and Chrome does not (I prefer it not to add the space, so Chrome gives me the desired functionality.)

## How did you build it?
This was my first ever application. I wrote it using purely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks. No libraries. Not even jQuery. I wanted to solidify the few concepts I had learned in JavaScript by adding functionality to something. This application was perfect for that.

## Credits
Other credit goes to Zeno Rocha, who created [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com "clipboard.js homepage"), which was used to add clipboard functionality to Jisho-Inject, and also to the wonderful people over at [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/ "Font Awesome") for creating a wonderful library of free icons.
